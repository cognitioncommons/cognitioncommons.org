# Contributing to Cognition Commons

## What we're looking for

- **Corrections** — factual errors, broken links, unclear explanations
- **Extensions** — new research notes on in-scope topics
- **References** — pointers to relevant academic work we missed
- **Clarifications** — rewording that improves understanding

## What we're not looking for

- Product promotions or vendor comparisons
- Content outside our [scope](https://cognitioncommons.org/about)
- AI-generated content without substantial human curation

## How to contribute

1. **Small fixes** — Open a PR directly
2. **New research notes** — Open an issue first to discuss scope and approach
3. **Disagreements** — Open an issue. We'd rather discuss than merge something controversial.

## Style

- Academic tone, not marketing
- Opinions welcome, but grounded in reasoning or implementation experience
- Cite sources where possible
- No hype words (revolutionary, breakthrough, game-changing)

## Governance

See [governance](https://cognitioncommons.org/governance). Short version: maintainers decide, fork freely if you disagree.
