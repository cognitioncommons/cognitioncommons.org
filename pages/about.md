# About Cognition Commons

Cognition Commons is an open research project focused on general intelligence architectures, alignment techniques, and scalable learning systems.

## Research Focus

The project explores practical approaches to building more capable and reliable AI systems:

**Cognitive Architectures** - Layered system designs that separate planning, reasoning, execution, and oversight into composable components.

**Multi-Agent Coordination** - Patterns for multiple AI models working together: orchestration, specialization, debate, and consensus.

**Tool-Using Agents** - Architectures for agents that effectively use external tools, APIs, and execution environments.

**Alignment & Interpretability** - Self-monitoring systems, uncertainty quantification, and techniques for understanding model behavior.

**Agent Frameworks** - Practical patterns for building, testing, and deploying agent systems.

## Approach

This project emphasizes:

1. **Practical over theoretical** - Working implementations over abstract frameworks
2. **Open documentation** - Publishing research notes for feedback and collaboration
3. **Reproducible methods** - Concrete patterns that can be implemented and tested
4. **Honest limitations** - Clear about what works, what doesn't, and what's unknown

## Why Open Research

Publishing research notes openly serves several purposes:

- **Rigor** - Writing forces clarity of thought
- **Feedback** - Others can identify gaps and errors
- **Collaboration** - Shared knowledge accelerates progress
- **Accountability** - Public commitments create follow-through
